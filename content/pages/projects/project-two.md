**Clicker Gods** is a Roblox clicker game, built entirely using Lua, that takes players on a journey to achieve godlike status through strategic clicking and progression. The game's core mechanics are centred around progressively clicking to accumulate divine energy, which players can use to unlock various upgrades, summon mythical creatures, and ascend to higher godly tiers.

In **Clicker Gods**, players start as mere mortals and work their way up by gathering energy with each click. As players progress, they can unlock powerful upgrades that increase their clicking efficiency, allowing them to accumulate energy faster and rise to divine ranks. The game offers a diverse set of upgrades, from increasing the power of each click to unlocking automated energy generation through mythical creatures and relics.

One of the standout features of **Clicker Gods** is the ascension mechanic. After reaching a certain level, players can "ascend," resetting their progress but gaining permanent divine blessings that make them more powerful in future runs. These blessings give players access to new abilities and powers that were previously unattainable, adding a strategic element to the game's progression system. The more players ascend, the closer they get to becoming the ultimate deity.

The game also includes a competitive aspect, with global leaderboards that track players' progress, encouraging players to compete for the top spot as the most powerful god in the universe. Players can also unlock cosmetic items, achievements, and special titles that reflect their status and accomplishments in the game.

**Clicker Gods** was developed using Lua, the primary scripting language in Roblox, and is a demonstration of my skills in both game design and scripting. The game incorporates efficient resource management, smooth gameplay mechanics, and a rewarding progression system that keeps players engaged. Throughout development, I focused on optimizing the game's performance, ensuring that even with complex mechanics and hundreds of upgrades, the game runs smoothly across various devices.

With **Clicker Gods**, I aimed to create an immersive experience that challenges players to think strategically while offering an enjoyable and addictive gameplay loop. It showcases my ability to build dynamic and scalable game systems in Lua, and it is a testament to my passion for game development.
