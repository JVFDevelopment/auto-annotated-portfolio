**minimod** is a lightweight Discord moderation bot built to simplify server management and enhance the experience for community administrators. Developed with flexibility and ease of use in mind, **minimod** offers a comprehensive suite of moderation tools that enable server admins to maintain order, enforce rules, and keep their communities safe with minimal effort.

At its core, **minimod** provides essential moderation features such as kicking, banning, and muting users with quick commands. It also includes advanced functionality like automatic message filtering, spam detection, and customizable word blacklists to prevent inappropriate content from being posted. With real-time monitoring, admins are notified immediately when problematic behavior occurs, allowing them to take swift action.

The bot is designed to be highly customizable, offering administrators the ability to tailor its behavior to suit the needs of their server. Server-specific settings, role-based permissions, and custom commands give admins full control over how **minimod** operates. This level of customization ensures that **minimod** can adapt to the unique moderation requirements of any Discord community, from small friend groups to large public servers.

**minimod** also provides detailed logging features, allowing admins to review user activity, moderation actions, and message deletions. This ensures transparency and accountability within the community, helping to maintain a positive environment. The bot is optimized for efficiency, ensuring that it runs smoothly without burdening the server, even during high-traffic moments.

Written in Python, **minimod** leverages the Discord API and various libraries to offer a seamless integration into any server. Its simple command structure makes it accessible for users of all experience levels, from novice admins to seasoned Discord moderators.

Whether you're looking to automate routine tasks or need a reliable tool to handle moderation on a larger scale, **minimod** provides the perfect balance of simplicity and functionality. This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, create user-friendly tools, and solve real-world problems through programming.
